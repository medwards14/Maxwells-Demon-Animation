# Maxwells-Demon-Animation
This project is an interactive C++ simulation I made of James Clerk Maxwell's famous thought experiment in thermodynamics known as Maxwellâ€™s Demon. I implemented this project using the SFML graphics library in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022. The animation visually represents the thought experiment, where the user plays the role of the demon.
